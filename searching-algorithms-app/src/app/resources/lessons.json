        "description": "Hashing in search algorithms involves converting data into a fixed-size hash code, which serves as an index for efficient data retrieval. This process allows for quick data lookup, as the hash code maps directly to a specific location or bucket in a data structure, such as a hash table. It's commonly used to optimize search operations and is known for its fast and constant-time access to stored values.",
