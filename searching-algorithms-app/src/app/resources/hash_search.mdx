## Search Algorithm: Hashing

Hashing search algorithm involves:
- Converting data into a fixed-size hash code, which serves as an **index for efficient data retrieval**
- **Quick data lookup**
- It's commonly used to **optimize search operations**
- Known for its **fast and constant-time access to stored values.**

In order to person the hashing search algorithm, we need:
1. Hash table
2. Hashing Function

In the demonstration we are going to use a hashing function that maps the letters of the alphabet to the numbers 1 to 26. The hash table consists of 26 available slots.

## Inserting into Hash Table
Before we are able to perform searching from a hash table we are going to go through the process of inserting into a hash table. We'll start by inserting the word **cat**.

When the word **cat** goes through the hashing function, the hashing function returns index 3

We therefore insert the word **cat** in index 3 of the hash table.

When inserting the word **box**, the hashing function returns the index 2 and is therefore inserted in index 2 in the hash table.

## Searching from Hash Table
Now we are going to perform searching from a hash table. The words that we are going to be searching for are:
1. cat
2. box
3. book
4. egg

How we go about looking for the words is almost the reserve of how we inserted into the hashing function.

We are now going to look for the word **cat**.

Firstly, we pass the word **cat** into the hashing function. The hashing function will return index 3. We then go to hash table and go directly to index 3 and we get back the word **cat**. The same process is followed when searching for the word **box**.

We are now going to look for the word **book**.

We pass the word **book** to the hashing function and it returns index 2. We then go to the hash table and look at index 2, but we find the word **box**. So the word **book** was not found.

We do the same for the word **egg** - **egg** is passed into the hashing function and index 5 is returned. We then go to the hash table and look at index 5, but there's no word at index 5 in the hash table. So the word **egg** was not found.

## Benefits of Hashing Search Algorithm
- Faster retrieval
	- Searching for the element takes the same amount of time as searching for the first element of an array.
	- This is a constant time or O(1).
